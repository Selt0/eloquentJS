//Chapter 1 Notes

//ternary operator
The value on the left of the question mark 'picks' which value will come out
console.log(true ? 1 : 2);
// 1
console.log(false ? 1: 2);
// 2

The || operator will return the first half if its true, then move to the second if its false. You can use this to set up a default behavior

console.log( null || 'user');
// 'user'

console.log( 'Agnes' || 'user');
// 'Agnes'

o, NaN, "" -> false

//short-circuit evaluation
true || x
x can be anything- even a virus- but it will never run because the first result was true. 
false && x
Same principle. the && checks the left side to see if its false. If its not, it checks the right side. However, once the left side is false, it won't run X.
